Next shipped update:
- snooze modal
    - custom input section should be a grid layout so inputs are aligned. Add another radio section that's when to display, either x days before or custom day/time
    - What should buttons say if snoozing an item that isn't today? "tomorrow" doesn't really make sense
    - aesthetics
- backend logic for repeats and display
    - possible add/edits for repeating items:
        - add new item which repeats.
            - In this case, just go ahead and add all of them. After adding first, store that item's id as repeatRootId in all repitition entries
            - If repeat never ends, make and upload them up to SOME_DATE_OFFSET in the future or SOME_NUMBER_OF_STORED_REPEATS, whichever limit is hit first
                - Then in user bd, store _id of repeating root item in list along with which limit was hit and other info needed to make more in the future easily
        - Edit item, impacts all items in repeat group
            - Find all items that aren't done in repeat group (can search by repeatRootId) and update them all accordingly
            - Make sure to update user limit info if hit a limit this time or last time this group was edited
        - Edit item, impacts all future items in repeat group
            - Same but also add search criteria for future relative to this item
            - When making edits, should calculate info for a new repeat group that these are now a part of (i.e. the last 5 repeats get a new group with only 5 occurences until done).
                - Root item is one being edited
                - Also update old group to end at the new appropriate time
        - Edit item, impacts just this one
            - Remove from repeat group. Leave original group alone, so if edits are made the equivalent item here would get recreated.
                - This might need to be changed in the future? Not sure what the best way to do this is
    - always request up to SOME_LIMIT items (using aggregate to sort and then limit).
        - If returns that number, and more can be made that would be displayed, indicate this in return msg
        - If mongodb returns fewer and more can be made and would be displayed, make more first before returning
        - If returns that number or fewer and no more would be displayed, indicate that in return msg
- Edit modal: when editing repeating item, confirm whether applies to all, just this one, all following
- bug on phone when editing last word left off


Should implement at some point:
- allow swipe left to mark (un)done
- backend needs to handle weird input without crashing (like weird auth tokens that ObjectID won't accept)
- keyboard shortcuts!
- center aligned dropdowns get all screwy with animations
- in repeat section, automatically set parameters to match the relevant date
- Add button in each category
- calendar doesn't fit on mobile. Make calendar work again under streak info
- streak calculation should just count days where there were tasks. Maybe aggregate: select within streak range, project onto donedate, count unique values?


Nice to have, not need to have:
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- animation for list footer moving smoothly
- done items can jiggle when hovered and not hovered (recreate with 4 not done and 1 done)
- there's probably some bugs when people switch between time zones
- confetti when completed a day
- sound effect when something's completed

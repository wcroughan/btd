- make editing the default list that draggable library, and also when an empty field loses focus it dissapears, and always have an empty field at the end
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- swipe input for yesterday/tomorrow navigation
- getListsForId needs to be reworked iwth the following:
    - getListsForDatestr instead
    - Searches by gt/lt start/end
    - Each list should have a separate "category" field (do I need datestr too?). Then can search by date, then have a list of required list categories that a default is generated for as well

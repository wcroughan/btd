Next shipped update:
- controllers 
    - applyUpdateToReproot: applies update, and also recurses through children reproots and unsets there so they always trace back (althoguh I guess repeatInfo needs to actually be set). Also remember correspondence between firstDueDate and dueDate, possibly others
    - splitRepeatChain: if n == 0, do nothing, otherwise insert a node into the linked list that is reproots. Note need to add field for relative N and also update all the items that should point to new reproot now
    - recalculateRepeatingDates sets all the duedate and displaydate fields of single items. Maybe could pass actual data instead of an id if it's available?
- also controllers getItems logic hasn't been updated at all
- Ugh need to be more rigorous about repeatInfo updates since it's copied.
    - add a field that indicates if repeatInfo is same or different from parent
    - When modifying repeatInfo, possibly traverse up to parent and also modify there, and to children
    - updateRootToEndHere def need to traverse ... replace updateOne with findandmodify or whatever tha tfunciton is


- terrible font on single vs future update dropdown
- repeat dialog, if weekly, add option to select which week days. Also make weekly the default
- When retrieving lists, check if need to extend repeats
- backend logic for repeats and display
    - always request up to SOME_LIMIT items (using aggregate to sort and then limit).
        - If returns that number, and more can be made that would be displayed, indicate this in return msg
        - If mongodb returns fewer and more can be made and would be displayed, make more first before returning
        - If returns that number or fewer and no more would be displayed, indicate that in return msg
- bug on phone when editing last word left off
- When deleting, ask if applies to future
- streak info


Should implement at some point:
- allow swipe left to mark (un)done
- backend needs to handle weird input without crashing (like weird auth tokens that ObjectID won't accept)
- keyboard shortcuts!
- center aligned dropdowns get all screwy with animations
- in repeat section, automatically set parameters to match the relevant date
- Add button in each category
- calendar doesn't fit on mobile. Make calendar work again under streak info
- streak calculation should just count days where there were tasks. Maybe aggregate: select within streak range, project onto donedate, count unique values?
- in current logic, single updates that also have changes to repeat schedule ignore those changes. Can probably solve quickly by separating repeatInfo and showInfo
- acid transactions


Nice to have, not need to have:
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- animation for list footer moving smoothly
- done items can jiggle when hovered and not hovered (recreate with 4 not done and 1 done)
- there's probably some bugs when people switch between time zones
- confetti when completed a day
- sound effect when something's completed

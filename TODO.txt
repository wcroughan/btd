Before shipping:
- header rework: finish calendar widget and connect to backend, update streak info and make that dropdown calendar too

Should implement at some point:
- swipe input for yesterday/tomorrow navigation
- getListsForId needs to be reworked iwth the following:
    - getListsForDatestr instead
    - Searches by gt/lt start/end
    - Each list should have a separate "category" field (do I need datestr too?). Then can search by date, then have a list of required list categories that a default is generated for as well
- change blue list footer buttons to some kind of grey blue
- general font exploration and color scheme and maybe prettier borders in actual list
- Use composition API to make an API handler with provides for data and update methods and an API child that gets those using inject so don't have to have emit chains. Note more info might have to be passed down, can have list provide listid etc (not necessarily thorugh composition api)
- allow swipe left to mark (un)done
- backend needs to handle weird input without crashing (like weird auth tokens that ObjectID won't accept)
- keyboard shortcuts!
- center aligned dropdowns get all screwy with animations
- move to yesterday text but for weeks is wrong
- ability to reorder list (not just default list)

Nice to have, not need to have:
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- animation for list footer moving smoothly
- done items can jiggle when hovered and not hovered (recreate with 4 not done and 1 done)

Next shipped update:
- streak info
- Allow repeating items on custom schedule like google calendar
- instead of all these moves, just have a snooze option with a modal
- header: Add menu items on left to view previous items, upcoming items, and repeating items
- create a modal for adding/editing items
- streak info
- trigger loading the items from the server at 5min interval after loading
- add a refresh button somewhere
- ability to mark an item as not overdue
- refresh button. Also auto refreshes every (idk, 5 mins?)
- calendar doesn't fit on mobile
- Add button in each category
- Long press to rearrange items. Can just implement always as rearrangable with handle, have v-if/else b/w handle and checkbox (and maybe on right side between ellipses menu and select checkmark for things like deleting many)
- Stop click from propogating with clicking edit -> save/cancel



Should implement at some point:
- figure out this reactivity stuff so can just use date object directly in btdCalendar as opposed to converting to and from a string
- allow swipe left to mark (un)done
- backend needs to handle weird input without crashing (like weird auth tokens that ObjectID won't accept)
- keyboard shortcuts!
- center aligned dropdowns get all screwy with animations
- image backgrounds white against blue like the alert symbol on login page

Nice to have, not need to have:
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- animation for list footer moving smoothly
- done items can jiggle when hovered and not hovered (recreate with 4 not done and 1 done)
- there's probably some bugs when people switch between time zones
- more efficient streak calculation
- confetti when completed a day

Next shipped update:
- instead of all these moves, just have a snooze option with a modal
- header: Add menu items on left to view previous items, upcoming items, and repeating items
- aesthetics for modal for adding/editing items
- backend logic for repeats and display
- ability to mark an item as not overdue
- Long press to rearrange items. Can just implement always as rearrangable with handle, have v-if/else b/w handle and checkbox (and maybe on right side between ellipses menu and select checkmark for things like deleting many)
- streak calculation should just count days where there were tasks. Maybe aggregate: select within streak range, project onto donedate, count unique values?
- no items screen looks like garbage


Should implement at some point:
- figure out this reactivity stuff so can just use date object directly in btdCalendar as opposed to converting to and from a string
- allow swipe left to mark (un)done
- backend needs to handle weird input without crashing (like weird auth tokens that ObjectID won't accept)
- keyboard shortcuts!
- center aligned dropdowns get all screwy with animations
- image backgrounds white against blue like the alert symbol on login page
- in repeat section, automatically set parameters to match the relevant date
- modal key press responses
- Add button in each category
- add a refresh button somewhere
- exact spacing with header and first list
- calendar doesn't fit on mobile. Make calendar work again under streak info


Nice to have, not need to have:
- make a smaller curved arrow image so less to download
- dark mode at night
- animation for list footer moving smoothly
- done items can jiggle when hovered and not hovered (recreate with 4 not done and 1 done)
- there's probably some bugs when people switch between time zones
- confetti when completed a day
